# T's Code Cracker 🔐

This is a simple number-guessing game I built while learning Python. It helps practice using `if`, `elif`, and loops while also making you think through logic. The goal is to guess a secret 3-digit code with no repeating numbers. The game gives you hints after every guess so you’re not completely lost.

## What it does

- Randomly picks a 3-digit code using digits 0–9 (no repeats)
- Gives you 10 chances to guess the right code
- After every guess, it gives clues to help:
  - **Match** — You got the right number in the right spot
  - **Close** — The number is in the code, but in the wrong spot
  - **Nope** — That number ain’t in the code at all
- Ends if you guess it or run out of tries

## Why I made this

I’m learning Python and wanted another project to help me get better at `if/else` statements, loops, and comparing lists. After finishing my ATM project, I wanted something a little more logic-heavy but still fun to play. This was just the right kind of challenge.

## How to run it

1. Open the `.py` file in VS Code (or whatever you're using)
2. Hit the green play/run button
3. Use the terminal to type in your guesses when it asks

## Stuff I might add later

- Difficulty modes (like a 4-digit version)
- Replay option after the game ends
- Cleaner formatting and maybe a timer
- High score or attempt tracker

## Updates

- `v1.0` – First version! Fully working with code generation, input checks, clue logic, and game loop
